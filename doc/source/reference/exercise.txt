YAML Format
-----------

.. code-block:: yaml

   ref: <string>
   languages:
     <string>:
       src: <path>
       test-command: <shell command>

Mut will run the given ``test-command`` in the system shell within the
directory containing ``src``. If ``test-command`` returns a non-zero
exit code, Mut will log a warning.

``test-command`` may be ``null`` to indicate that there is no test.

Example
-------

Create the following file at
``source/includes/exercise-tutorial.yaml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ref: foo
   languages:
     javascript:
       src: /source/exercises/foo.js
       test-command: "node test-foo.js"
     python:
       src: /source/exercises/foo.py
       test-command: null
   ...

Mut will then create the following output files:

- ``source/includes/exercise/foo-javascript.rst``
- ``source/includes/exercise/foo-python.rst``
